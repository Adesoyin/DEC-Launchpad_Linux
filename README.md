# DEC-Launchpad---Linux

## Purpose
This project is set up for a data processing pipeline using Linux commands and bash scripts. It covers:
1. File manipulation, 
2. Data automation, 
3. Permissions management, and 
4. Scheduling with cron, & logging.

## Setting up the environment
The server was connected to using ssh in a git bash terminal

    ssh adeboladesoyin@***.**.**.**

Created 3 different directories for organizing the pipeline

    mkdir data_pipeline
    cd data_pipeline
    mkdir input output logs
    ls -l

The input directory would store the data
The output will store the processed data, and the logs will save the history.
